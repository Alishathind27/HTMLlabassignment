           <p>Stored and reheated the right way, they’re just as flavorful as they were the day they were made.
             And when I have a freezer full of nourishing homemade meals, there’s no reason to eat out or order in.</p>

           <p>When you want to freeze soup, allow it to cool completely before freezing it in airtight, freezer-safe containers.
             Transfer them to the fridge to thaw overnight and reheat the soup on the stove, or defrost frozen soup in
              the microwave.</p>

         <h5>Curried Lentil Salad</h5>
        <img src="Images/Healthy food/lentil-salad.jpg" alt="lentil salad" height="195" width="260">

         <p>French green lentils – Unlike regular green or brown lentils,
           French green lentils hold their shape when cooked, and they have a nice al dente bite.</p>
           <p>Paneer – Cubes of roasted paneer add a rich, savory, and chewy element to this salad.
             If you’re not familiar with paneer,it’s a fresh Indian cheese. Look for it in the cheese section of your grocery store.</p>

         <h5>French oinion soup</h5>
        <img src="Images/Healthy food/Turkish-Salad-by-PictureTheRecipe.jpg" alt="turkish salad" height="195" width="260">

         <p>To make it, I turn to my go-to ingredients for adding meaty flavor to plant-based recipes: tamari and balsamic vinegar.
           As with my veggie burgers and vegan meatballs, they make this soup taste wonderfully savory and tangy.</p>
